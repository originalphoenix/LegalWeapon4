Description
===========

![KodingBadge](http://i.imgur.com/HgV7Xpg.png)

We picked the legal theme because we understand more than most people how useless the terms of service are in the website until you get caught in them for one reason or another. We understand the importance of the finer details and that includes the fine print. We wanted to use our design skills to come up with an easy system for people who want to be informed without wasting time. When legal documents get too long, no one bothers to read them, so we decided to create Legalease to parse legal documents for the important parts and award colorful badges based on their policy. Any legal document works, just copy and paste into the box and see it work!
